# I. INTRODUCTION

The rapidly evolving job market and increasing competition among job seekers have created significant challenges for candidates preparing for employment interviews. Following graduation, timely and effective interview preparation is essential for securing desired job positions and building successful careers. But conventional preparation methods mostly depend on self-study efforts, which can be time-consuming, unstructured, and ineffective because candidates often lack awareness of their specific weaknesses and skill gaps. The preparation process involves multiple aspects like technical knowledge, communication skills, and confidence building, causing the overall effort to proceed at a slow pace and putting career opportunities at risk. This systematic approach not only enhances the effectiveness and timeliness of interview preparation but also lessens candidates' anxiety by providing structured feedback and limiting their exposure to unexpected interview situations.[1]

Recent developments in web technologies, natural language processing, and data analytics have opened up new avenues for enhancing career guidance and interview preparation activities. Online platforms offer a unique advantage in preparation activities by providing accessible resources, structured learning paths, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Upon being equipped with resume parsing and skill extraction capabilities, these platforms can efficiently analyze candidate profiles, identify skill gaps, and transmit targeted improvement recommendations to users, cutting down the preparation time significantly and maximizing the resource utilization. In analyzing candidate profiles from uploaded resumes, conventional methods mainly extract information using keyword matching, employing basic pattern recognition and rule-based approaches.[2]

Career preparation platforms that are used today can be categorized into two types. The first is those which provide static content and generic advice. Quality personalized feedback is not common in these platforms and are mostly used for basic information gathering and general interview tips.[3] This type of platform can also be used for preliminary preparation but are comparatively less efficient because they always demand additional research and self-assessment. The second group of platforms contain intelligent components, and there are systems in which certain features are partially automated for analysis. Skill extraction and feedback generation modules are normally embedded into these platforms, but some systems do not consist of comprehensive analysis capabilities. In these advanced systems, the analysis section is independently processed and is kept continuously updated to reflect current market requirements. New technologies in web development, data processing, and pattern matching have brought new opportunities for improving interview preparation systems. But these platforms have limited capabilities since they always require manual intervention for personalized guidance.[4] So to overcome this limitation, an integrated approach combining automated resume analysis with structured feedback mechanisms is necessary.

This paper presents a comprehensive interview preparation system designed to enhance candidate readiness by integrating automated resume analysis, skill gap identification, and structured feedback generation. The system leverages pattern matching algorithms for accurate skill extraction, ensuring that relevant technical competencies are quickly identified and categorized from user-submitted resumes. A framework for career assessment by analyzing candidate profiles against target role requirements has been developed. The skill extraction module processes resume data efficiently, and the feedback generation component provides actionable improvement recommendations.[5] Additionally, the automated progress tracking mechanism monitors preparation patterns, reducing manual effort and improving overall efficiency. The collected assessment data is processed systematically, enabling coordinated guidance between different preparation modules. By combining data-driven analytics with structured learning resources, this system aims to enhance the effectiveness of interview preparation activities, ultimately improving success rates and minimizing time investment for job seekers.
