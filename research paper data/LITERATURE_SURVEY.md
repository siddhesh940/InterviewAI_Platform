**R. Umbare, A. Budhodkar, S. Suryawanshi, S. Udgirkar, P. Aher, and S. Rangdale** "AI Powered Mock Interview System with Real-Time Voice and Emotion Analysis" (2025) [1] This paper presents an AI-powered mock interview platform that integrates facial recognition, speech emotion detection, CNN, and RNN models for real-time voice and emotion analysis. The system focuses on improving user confidence by evaluating both verbal and non-verbal performance through adaptive feedback. It enhances emotion-based scoring, confidence analysis, and response adaptability, making interviews more realistic. However, it faces limitations like bias in emotion recognition and limited dataset diversity, which can impact performance accuracy. Our proposed system addresses both limitations by incorporating 1000+ practice questions across quantitative aptitude, verbal ability, and logical reasoning categories, along with company-specific preparation materials for six major IT recruiters (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, Accenture, CapGemini). To overcome emotion recognition bias, the system integrates facial analysis framework for emotion tracking and comprehensive soft skills training modules covering communication, confidence, body language, active listening, and professionalism with videos, tips, quizzes, and checklists that systematically improve both verbal and non-verbal interview performance.

**B. B. Jadhav, A. Sawant, A. Shah, and S. Yadav** "A Comprehensive Study and Implementation of Mock Interview Simulator with AI and Pose-Based Interaction" (2024) [2] This paper proposes a deep learning-based mock interview simulator that combines speech analysis and body pose tracking to deliver detailed behavioral feedback. The method strengthens AI-based behavior recognition and gesture analysis, helping users enhance communication and presentation skills. It introduces pose-based interaction as a unique feature for evaluating soft skills during interviews. However, it requires high-end computational resources and lacks multi-language support, which limits its accessibility. Our system overcomes computational limitations by utilizing cloud-based Retell AI for voice processing, which handles all intensive processing on server-side, allowing the platform to run smoothly on standard web browsers without requiring high-end client hardware.

**P. K. Mishra, A. K. Arulappan, I.-H. Ra, L. T. Mariappan, G. G. Rose, and Y.-S. Lee** "AI-Driven Virtual Mock Interview Development" (2024) [3] In this research, the authors employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to assess tone, clarity, and structure of answers in virtual interviews. The system generates personalized, domain-specific question sets, offering an engaging and adaptive interview experience. It improves communication skills and confidence through realistic AI-driven feedback mechanisms. The limitation noted is that emotion detection accuracy heavily depends on data quality and training models. Our system provides comprehensive skill development through five interactive games (Fix the Bad Answer, Keyword Hunt, Rephrase Me, Keyword Mapping, Truth or Bluff) that focus on interview communication skills, reducing dependency on emotion detection accuracy. Additionally, the system has integrated facial analysis framework with emotion tracking capabilities designed to process video frames for confidence, engagement, and stress evaluation.

**J. V. Barpute, O. Wattamwar, S. Pakjade, and S. Diwate** "A Survey of AI-Driven Mock Interviews using GenAI and Machine Learning (InterviewX)" (2024) [4] This paper surveys AI-driven mock interview models utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), QLoRA, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated question generation and scoring. It highlights the potential of GenAI-based systems for delivering personalized and scalable interview feedback. The study advances AI-based adaptability and efficiency in mock interview solutions. However, it is limited by high computational costs and the need for GPU-based infrastructure for real-time operation. Our system eliminates GPU dependency by leveraging cloud APIs including Retell AI for voice interviews and OpenAI API for question generation, with Supabase handling database operations, making the entire platform accessible through standard web hosting.

**Y.-C. Chou, F. R. Wongso, C.-Y. Chao, and H.-Y. Yu** "An AI Mock-Interview Platform for Interview Performance Analysis" (2022) [5] In this study, the authors introduce an AI-based mock interview platform designed to simulate real-time interviews and provide automated evaluations. The system applies machine learning algorithms for instant feedback, enhancing user preparation and self-assessment. It successfully demonstrates the integration of AI in performance evaluation, improving engagement and accessibility. However, its limitation lies in restricted emotional intelligence and lack of advanced facial behavior analysis, which affects holistic feedback quality. Our proposed system addresses this through comprehensive soft skills training modules covering five key areas (communication, confidence, body language, active listening, professionalism) with videos, tips, quizzes, and checklists. The platform includes advanced analytics generation with overall scoring, communication assessment with detailed feedback, and soft skill evaluation summaries. Additionally, integrated resume analysis with skill autofill, aptitude training with 1000+ questions, and career trajectory prediction through Time Machine provide holistic candidate assessment beyond interview performance.
